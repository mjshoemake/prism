Ok. So I'm not 100% sure that Power BI will do what I need it to do, but we'll see. Here's what I actually want:

Ideally, the user should be able to select a metric (Say/Do Ratio, Scope Churn, etc.), possibly with a picklist. Once they've done that, they should be able to choose whether they want to focus on Time (ie. sprints) or Organization (ie. teams). That label would be "Focus Area". If they choose Time, the bar graph will have bars for time. If they choose organization, the bar graph will have bars for directors, or senior managers, or managers, or teams. When they first switch to a focus area, the bars should be based on the highest level (in our case CEO which is level 5). If they click the bar for the CEO, that should drill in, add level5=<CEO name> to the list of filters, and show a bar for each level 4 value. Then they can click on an SVP and add that to the list of filters. That will show bars for each director (level 3). Then the user can switch to Focus Area = Time and that will show the highest level within Time which is year. SO there will be a bar for each year represented in the data. But, then there will also be a "Focus Level" picklist where the user can select a different focus level for that focus area. If Focus Area = Time, then Focus Levels will be Year, Year & Quarter, Year & Month, Quarter, Month, Sprint. That allows them to change focus level to Month or Sprint without having to drill down to get there.
